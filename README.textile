A sample chat application using the Java API for Akka
Basically a port of:
"https://github.com/jboner/akka/tree/master/akka-samples/akka-sample-chat/":https://github.com/jboner/akka/tree/master/akka-samples/akka-sample-chat/

Akka version = 1.0-RC5
Akka API = Java

Outstanding issues:
* RedisStorage doesn't seem to support the add() method. Have created a ticket.
* I haven't figured out what the Java API version of "self.lifeCycle = Permanent" is yet. Todo.

Instructions:
# Download Redis: "http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list":http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list
# Build Redis: ‘make install’
# Run Redis: ‘./redis-server’
# Run akka_chat_java: "https://github.com/alexaverbuch/akka_chat_java/blob/master/src/main/java/chat/Runner.java":https://github.com/alexaverbuch/akka_chat_java/blob/master/src/main/java/chat/Runner.java
